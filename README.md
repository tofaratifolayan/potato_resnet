# Potato Virus Classification
Based on a Kaggle dataset (link in Colab), the aim was to beat the best accuracy available.
Made a custom ResNet to classify potato viruses with 90% accuracy, which wasn't enough, so we manipulated a pretrained Visual Transformerto fit our needs, and got 99.4% accuracy
